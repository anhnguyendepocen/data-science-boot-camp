# Basic R Intro

The basic container of data in R is the vector. Vectors in R can be defined directly with
the function `c()`:
```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
y <- c(5, 6)
x + y
```

Observe above that the two vectors are added element-wise and that the shorter
vector is recycled.

View a complete list of basic operators by running the following command:
```
?+.
```

Specify a seed for the pseudo-random number generator, take draws from two normally 
distributed random variables, and find their correlation.
```{r}
set.seed(101)

x <- rnorm(50)
y <- x + rnorm(50, mean = 25, sd = 0.1)

cor(x, y)
```

Look at summary statistics for these random variables:
```{r}
summary(x)
mean(x)
var(x)
sqrt(var(x))
sd(x)
```

# Basic visual exploration

Load `ggplot2` and plot scatterplots of the random variables:
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

df <- data.frame(cbind(x, y))
summary(df)

ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) + geom_point()
```

# Loading data

## SQLite example

The following [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) database was downloaded from 
Kaggle at [https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data](https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data)

The data is available in SQLite format, so we will make use of the `RSQLite` package

```{r}
library(DBI)
#install.packages("RSQLite")
mydb <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "data/lending-club.sqlite")
dbListTables(mydb)
dbListFields(mydb, "loan")
loan10k <- dbGetQuery(mydb, "SELECT * FROM loan LIMIT 10000;")
# loan <- dbReadTable(mydb, "loan") # to grab the whole thing
dbDisconnect(mydb)
```

The above SQL, `SELECT * FROM loan LIMIT 10000;`, translates to requesting all
all fields (or columns) from the `loan` table, limiting our result to the first 10,000 records.

Summarize the loan data. Let's focus on two variables, the reported annual income, `annual_inc`, and the loan amount, `loan_amnt`.

```{r}
summary(loan10k$annual_inc)
ggplot(loan10k, aes(annual_inc)) + geom_histogram() + geom_rug()
```

From the above plot, it should be clear the data is not normal. So let's take the log of
annual income.

```{r}
loan10k$ln_annual_inc <- log(loan10k$annual_inc) 
```

```{r}
summary(loan10k$loan_amnt)
ggplot(loan10k, aes(annual_inc, loan_amnt)) + geom_point()
```

This section is an intro to dplyr

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
