for rJava need to
1. install JDK
2. on MacOS may need to run the following command that makes the needed library visible
where R is looking for it
`sudo ln -f -s $(/usr/libexec/java_home)/jre/lib/server/libjvm.dylib /usr/local/lib`


I should be able to run through all my examples using Docker, then run
docker save to make sure all the dependencies are there.

To run Spark you will need the JDK.

I should give everyone instructions on how to
1. Install R (get 3.4)
2. Install RStudio
3. Install all the necessary libraries
